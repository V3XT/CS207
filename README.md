This repository contains all files and documents related to our final project for CS207

The project consists of a ruben's tube, and an Arduino Uno programmed to generate waveforms
of varying frequency. The Arduino uses two potentiometers to set the frequency of the waves,
which are converted into analog signals using an R-2R digital to analog converter.
